# WATonomous ASD Admissions Assignment (finally finished)

Doing this assignment was a hard but rewarding marathon. It took much longer than expected to implement each node, however after countless hours we finally finished the assignment (fully functional). This project is an autonomous agent that reads LasarScans converting it into a costmap (grid that quantifies the chances of an object existing within it), then takes the costmaps over time to form a global map, after this uses A* search algo to find a route to a desired point and finally uses pursuit control to move. 

Thank you to the WATonomous team for designing an amazing assignment and we really enjoyed the process of completing it.
